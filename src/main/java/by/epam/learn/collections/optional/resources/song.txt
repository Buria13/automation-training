But that's not the shape of my heart
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier

The numbers lead a dance
The hidden law of a probable outcome
The sacred geometry of chance
He deals the cards to find the answer

He don't play for respect
He doesn't play for the money he wins
And those he plays never suspect
He deals the cards as a meditation
